 Fix child selection code - Handle equal coord cases
 Implement destructor
 Handle switch from leaf to central node ( Move dataPoint, solve conflicts with colliding points)

 Change if/else tree in child selection to whichChild() function. Much faster.

 Change coord types to doubles to handle fractional coords
